# ***Research log Week 1***

I’m Dion and this is my first entry to my technical writing research log.  My first initial understanding or assumptions about technical writing was writing tailor for business or office environment.  I thought these included things like “memo’s” and presentations for reports or pitches.  Or guides and standards for companies.  But the way I’m seeing it now, it seems like it’s mostly for manuals or directions.



The guide to setting up an account and repository on GitHub was written very well in my opinion.  Was very easy to follow and setup my account.  I did not notice until you pointed it out but while writing in the *.md file format, everything is very basic.  No font or special text it seems.

This week I feel like I learn a lot this week.  This GitHub site seems like a really good idea.  Start a project and getting others feedback to improve the project.  Or use GitHub to help start something of your own by building on shared/open projects out there already.  I also learn the actual meaning of technical writing.

# ***Research log Week 2***

In this update I'm going to reflect on my experience with creating instructions for my Lego design.  Right from the start I knew words wouldn’t be enough and it need to have images.  So I focus on how to best show images of a before and after in each step.  Also knowing that my audience was college students I felt images would be more than enough.  I felt I didn’t have to go into much details with the written text because of the images.  I choose PowerPoint because I feel it’s the easier way to display text and images together.  Only issue I had was printing them out in color.  My printed text printed out and a black-grey scale.  Some of my texts refer to the color of the Lego pieces and the images was in black and white.  Some points that I gather to use for my next instructions was to perhaps label the Lego pieces.   Adjust some of the images a little bit to make them a bit clearer.
