Research log

I’m Dion and this is my first entry to my technical writing research log.  My first initial understanding or assumptions about technical writing was writing tailor for business or office environment.  I thought these included things like “memo’s” and presentations for reports or pitches.  Or guides and standards for companies.  But the way I’m seeing it now, it seems like it’s mostly for manuals or directions.



The guide to setting up an account and repository on GitHub was written very well in my opinion.  Was very easy to follow and setup my account.  I did not notice until you pointed it out but while writing in the *.md file format, everything is very basic.  No font or special text it seems.

This week I feel like I learn a lot this week.  This GitHub site seems like a really good idea.  Start a project and getting others feedback to improve the project.  Or use GitHub to help start something of your own by building on shared/open projects out there already.  I also learn the actual meaning of technical writing.
